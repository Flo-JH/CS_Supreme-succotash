## Reflection on Essential Questions  

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
Interpreting user needs starts with understanding what the user is trying to accomplish and breaking those goals into smaller tasks. Creating user stories helps clarify these needs by describing the work from the user's perspective. In this course, user stories gave the team clear, actionable goals, allowing us to focus on delivering value with each sprint. They made it easier to prioritize features and ensure the program met the user’s expectations.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I approach developing programs by breaking the project into smaller, manageable pieces. Agile processes like sprints, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives were incredibly useful in this course. These processes help maintain focus, address challenges early, and improve team collaboration. In the future, I want to incorporate iterative development and continuous feedback into my work, as they allow for flexibility and constant improvement.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Being a good team member means communicating effectively, collaborating with others, and staying open to feedback. Throughout this project, daily stand-ups and retrospectives showed me how important it is to listen to teammates and share updates. Supporting the team, being adaptable, and ensuring everyone works toward the same goal are key to building a successful software project.
